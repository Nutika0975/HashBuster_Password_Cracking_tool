##HashBuster Password Cracking Tool
HashBuster is a web-based password hash cracking tool that helps in identifying weak or commonly used passwords. Designed for ethical security assessments, it provides an intuitive interface for cracking hashes using dictionary attacks.

üîê Features
Multi-Hash Algorithm Support: Supports popular hash types like MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and others.

Web-Based UI: Easy-to-use interface built with Node.js and Express.

Custom Wordlists: Upload your own wordlist to test password strength.

Real-Time Cracking Display: See progress and matched results dynamically.

Kali Linux /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Make sure to place the rockyou.txt file in the project directory.

üöÄ Future Scope
GPU Acceleration: Speed up hash cracking using GPU via CUDA/OpenCL integration.

More Hashing Algorithms: Add support for bcrypt, NTLM, SHA-512, and custom hash formats.

Cloud Integration: Enable distributed cracking over multiple machines.

Session Management: Save and resume cracking sessions.

Logging and Reporting: Generate structured output reports of cracked hashes (planned).
